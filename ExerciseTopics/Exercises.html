        <h1>Score of a String</h1>
        <div>
            You are given a string s. The score of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters.<br>
            Return the score of s.<br><br>
        </div>
        <div>
            Example 1:<br>
            Input: s = "hello"<br>
            Output: 13<br>
            Explanation:<br>
            The ASCII values of the characters <i></i>n s are: 'h' = 104, 'e' = 101, 'l' = 108, 'o' = 111. So, the score of s would be |104 - 101| + |101 - 108| + |108 - 108| + |108 - 111| = 3 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 13.<br><br>

            Example 2:<br>
            Input: s = "zaz"<br>
            Output: 50<br>
            Explanation:<br>
            The ASCII values of the characters in s are: 'z' = 122, 'a' = 97. So, the score of s would be |122 - 97| + |97 - 122| = 25 + 25 = 50.<br>

        <h1>Defanging an IP Address</h1>
        <div>
            Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.<br>
            A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".<br><br>
        </div>
        <div>
            Example 1:<br>
            Input: address = "1.1.1.1"<br>
            Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"<br><br>

            Example 2:<br>
            Input: address = "255.100.50.0"<br>
            Output: "255[.]100[.]50[.]0"<br>

        <h1>Permutation Difference between Two Strings</h1>
        <div>
            You are given two strings s and t such that every character occurs at most once in s and t is a permutation of s.<br>
            The permutation difference between s and t is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of each character in s and the index of the occurrence of the same character in t.<br>
            Return the permutation difference between s and t.<br><br>
        </div>
        <div>
            Example 1:<br>
            Input: s = "abc", t = "bac"<br>
            Output: 2<br>
            Explanation:<br>
            For s = "abc" and t = "bac", the permutation difference of s and t is equal to the sum of:<br>
            The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "a" in s and the index of the occurrence of "a" in t.<br>
            The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "b" in s and the index of the occurrence of "b" in t.<br>
            The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "c" in s and the index of the occurrence of "c" in t.<br>
            That is, the permutation difference between s and t is equal to |0 - 1| + |1 - 0| + |2 - 2| = 2.<br><br>

            Example 2:<br>
            Input: s = "abcde", t = "edbac"<br>
            Output: 12<br>
            Explanation: The permutation difference between s and t is equal to |0 - 3| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 4| + |3 - 1| + |4 - 0| = 12.<br>
        </div>

        <h1>Jewels and Stones</h1>
        <div>
            You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.<br>
            Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".<br><br>
        </div>
        <div>
            Example 1:<br>
            Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"<br>
            Output: 3<br><br>

            Example 2:<br>
            Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"<br>
            Output: 0<br>

        <h1>Find Words Containing Character</h1>
        <div>
            You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words and a character x.<br>
            Return an array of indices representing the words that contain the character x.<br>
            Note that the returned array may be in any order.<br><br>
        </div>
        <div>
            Example 1:<br>
            Input: words = ["leet","code"], x = "e"<br>
            Output: [0,1]<br>
            Explanation: "e" occurs in both words: "leet", and "code". Hence, we return indices 0 and 1.<br><br>

            Example 2:<br>
            Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "a"<br>
            Output: [0,2]<br>
            Explanation: "a" occurs in "abc", and "aaaa". Hence, we return indices 0 and 2.<br><br>

            Example 3:<br>
            Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "z"<br>
            Output: []<br>
            Explanation: "z" does not occur in any of the words. Hence, we return an empty array.<br>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="6">
        <h1>Goal Parser Interpretation</h1>
        <div>
            You own a Goal Parser that can interpret a string command. The command consists of an alphabet of "G", "()" and/or "(al)" in some order.<br>
            The Goal Parser will interpret "G" as the string "G", "()" as the string "o", and "(al)" as the string "al". The interpreted strings are then concatenated in the original order.<br>
            Given the string command, return the Goal Parser's interpretation of command.<br><br>
        </div>
        <div>
            Example 1:<br>
            Input: command = "G()(al)"<br>
            Output: "Goal"<br>
            Explanation: The Goal Parser interprets the command as follows:<br>
            G -> G<br>
            () -> o<br>
            (al) -> al<br>
            The final concatenated result is "Goal".<br><br>

            Example 2:<br>
            Input: command = "G()()()()(al)"<br>
            Output: "Gooooal"<br><br>

            Example 3:<br>
            Input: command = "(al)G(al)()()G"<br>
            Output: "alGalooG"<br>
        </div>

        <h1>Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences</h1>
        <div>
            A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.<br>
            You are given an array of strings sentences, where each sentences[i] represents a single sentence.<br>
            Return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.<br><br>
        </div>
        <div>
            Example 1:<br>
            Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]<br>
            Output: 6<br>
            Explanation:<br>
            - The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.<br>
            - The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.<br>
            - The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.<br>
            Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.<br><br>

            Example 2:<br>
            Input: sentences = ["please wait", "continue to fight", "continue to win"]<br>
            Output: 3<br>
            Explanation: It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number of words.<br>
            In this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same number of words.<br>

        <h1>Score of a String</h1>
        <div>
            You are given a string s. The score of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters.<br>
            Return the score of s.<br><br>
        </div>
        <div>
            Example 1:<br>
            Input: s = "hello"<br>
            Output: 13<br>
            Explanation:<br>
            The ASCII values of the characters <i></i>n s are: 'h' = 104, 'e' = 101, 'l' = 108, 'o' = 111. So, the score of s would be |104 - 101| + |101 - 108| + |108 - 108| + |108 - 111| = 3 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 13.<br><br>

            Example 2:<br>
            Input: s = "zaz"<br>
            Output: 50<br>
            Explanation:<br>
            The ASCII values of the characters in s are: 'z' = 122, 'a' = 97. So, the score of s would be |122 - 97| + |97 - 122| = 25 + 25 = 50.<br>

        <h1>Defanging an IP Address</h1>
        <div>
            Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.<br>
            A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".<br><br>
        </div>
        <div>
            Example 1:<br>
            Input: address = "1.1.1.1"<br>
            Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"<br><br>

            Example 2:<br>
            Input: address = "255.100.50.0"<br>
            Output: "255[.]100[.]50[.]0"<br>

        <h1>Permutation Difference between Two Strings</h1>
        <div>
            You are given two strings s and t such that every character occurs at most once in s and t is a permutation of s.<br>
            The permutation difference between s and t is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of each character in s and the index of the occurrence of the same character in t.<br>
            Return the permutation difference between s and t.<br><br>
        </div>
        <div>
            Example 1:<br>
            Input: s = "abc", t = "bac"<br>
            Output: 2<br>
            Explanation:<br>
            For s = "abc" and t = "bac", the permutation difference of s and t is equal to the sum of:<br>
            The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "a" in s and the index of the occurrence of "a" in t.<br>
            The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "b" in s and the index of the occurrence of "b" in t.<br>
            The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "c" in s and the index of the occurrence of "c" in t.<br>
            That is, the permutation difference between s and t is equal to |0 - 1| + |1 - 0| + |2 - 2| = 2.<br><br>

            Example 2:<br>
            Input: s = "abcde", t = "edbac"<br>
            Output: 12<br>
            Explanation: The permutation difference between s and t is equal to |0 - 3| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 4| + |3 - 1| + |4 - 0| = 12.<br>

        <h1>Jewels and Stones</h1>
        <div>
            You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.<br>
            Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".<br><br>
        </div>
        <div>
            Example 1:<br>
            Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"<br>
            Output: 3<br><br>

            Example 2:<br>
            Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"<br>
            Output: 0<br>
